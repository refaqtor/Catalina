This folder contains the sources for Catalina's changes to the Geany IDE.

These changes must be applied to Geany 1.37.1. Note that they have already 
been applied to the version of Geany found in this distribution
(i.e. source/geany-1.37.1).

Instructions for building Geany on both Windows and Linux can be found in 
the BUILD.TXT folder in the Catalina home directory.
