This folder contains an extension to eLua. ALOHA is a protocol designed to 
support remote procedure calls between propellers, and can be used from Lua
by the addition of a custom version of the eLua dispatcher. 

The protocol is called ALOHA in honour of the original ground-breaking ALOHA 
protocol. 

The ALOHA extensions to eLua are described in the document 'Aloha from Lua'.
See that document for more details.
