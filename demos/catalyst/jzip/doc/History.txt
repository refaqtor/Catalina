Jzip - Infocom Z-code Interpreter Program     V2.1
-----------------------------------------------------
Author: John Holder (j-holder@home.com)
Based on sources by Mark Howell & Olaf 'Olsen' Barthel

       This file contains a history of changes to the code base of Jzip.

Known Issues:
        - something is causing the comp2000 game "And the Waves Choke the Wind"
          by Gunther Schmidl to print text incorrectly. Finding and fixing
          this bug is top priority.
        - @aread/@sread is not quite up to spec.
        - adding support for Unicode opcodes/table per spec 1.0
          (currently, the hooks are in to look up the address of the table.
           nothing is done with it yet.)

Release 2.1, 04-Oct-2000
        - fixed bug in nested/redirected output streams when dealing w/ chars 
          outside the normal ASCII range (ie, ISO-Latin1).  This was causing
          the German translation of "Bear's Night Out" (bearg.z5) to display
          upside-down '?' instead of German eszett in some places.
        - renamed all opcode routines to z_opcodename to match functionality
          to Spec 1.0 more easily.

Release 2.1, 29-Jun-2000

        - NOW SPEC 1.0 COMPLIANT
        - fixed logical and arithmetic shift per spec 1.0 
        - fixed probelems with div and mod per spec 1.0 
        - rewrote much of property.c to handle 64 properties per spec 1.0 
        - fixed nested/redirected output streams per spec 1.0 (Xzip derived)
        - added support for extended load/save opcodes per spec 1.0 
        - added support for Quetzal portable save files (from Martin Frost)
               *** NOTE ***  Old save game files are now incompatible.
        - added ckifzs utility - checks if quetzal file is valid.
          improved to be more robust by John Kennedy.
        - added support for STRICTZ error checking (Xzip derived & extended)
        - @get_prop_len 0 returns zero per zmachine mailing list message
          from Graham.
        - Jzip's license is now very much less restrictive.
        - Added support for OS/2 and MS Quick C(DOS) (Thanks John Kennedy)
        - Can turn on Tandy bit (Thanks John Kennedy)
        - Can read Zcode files that have been compressed with gzip when
          built with -DUSE_ZLIB.  Requires the free Zlib, see
          http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/

Release 2.0.1g, 5-Dec-1995:

        - fixed silly error I introduced in osdepend.c (the set_colours bug)
        - fixed extra include in fileio.c (string.h doesn't need double
          inclusion)
        - fixed "magic" declaration that caused problems with jzexe.c on
          RISC boxen.

Release 2.0.1g:

        - John Menichelli(menichel@pixi.com) has added text editing 
          features and a command history to bccio.c (the Borland
          DOS interface).  Thanks, John!
        - With some termcap hacking and John Menichelli's code, I added
          text editing and command history functionality to the UNIX
          ports of Jzip.
        - At the moment, the DOS and UNIX versions now have the correct 
          timed read key interval of 1/10th of a second, instead of the 
          1 second interval that used to be there.
        - Dancer (dancer@gateway1.brisnet.org.au) has added an Atari ST
          port of Jzip to the distribution.  He has also got the command
          history and editing features working.  If you have problems
          with this port, contact him.  Better documentation is in Jzip.txt
        - You now can create standalone DOS executable files with
          Magnus Olsson's utility JZexe, which he has kindly added to
          the Jzip distribution.

Release 2.0.1f:

        - Jzip now supports a default set of paths where it will look for
          a game file if it isn't in the current directory.  Set the
          environment variable INFOCOM_PATH to the directory or list of
          directories that contain your Zcode story files. For example:
          UNIX:
            setenv INFOCOM_PATH /usr/games/zfiles/:/usr/jholder/zfiles
          DOS:
            set INFOCOM_PATH=d:\infocom\ltoi1;d:\infocom\ltoi2;
          Suggested by Michael Phillips, (msphil@aardvark.cc.wm.edu).
        - Jzip has a manpage!  Written by Michael Phillips, I will edit
          and maintain it from now on.  Thanks, Mike!
        - UNIX versions no longer die a horrible death and dump core,
          cause bus errors, or put the screen in an incorrect mode when
          attempting to run an invalid file.
	  
Release 2.0.1e:

	- Jzip's UNIX distribution is now even more portable!  Some
	  problems with SunOS HP-UX, and Irix have been resolved, all
	  thanks to Mark Phillips (msp@bnr.co.uk).  As you port Jzip
	  to different versions of UNIX, please tell me what platform
	  and version of UNIX you are running, and send me a copy of
	  your makefile so I can document it. 
	- Jzip save files are now PORTABLE between big-endian and little-
	  endian machines!  Once again, thanks to Mark Phillips!  Now
	  you can play at home on your PC, upload your save file to work,
	  and play on your lunch hour! (Note: The 27-sept-1995 release
	  had a typo in the code & this didn't work! Sorry!)
	  *** NOTE ***  Old save game files are now incompatible on some boxes.

Release 2.0.1d:

       - Jzip properly understand what game you are playing and will
         "automagically" name your save games files, script files, and
         record files appropriately.  (ie. if you are playing zork1.dat,
         your save file is zork1.sav, script file is zork1.scr, and
         record file is zork1.rec)
       - The Borland DOS compile now supports color or monochrome
         mode with the -m command line option.  
       - Jzip now properly prints menus on the DOS compile.  Thanks
         for noticing the problem & sending in the fix to Andrew
         Benham. (A.D.S.Benham@bnr.co.uk)

Release 2.0.1a:

        Jzip is an unofficial compile of Mark Howell's ZIP 
        interpreter.  Mark has not endorsed this compile, and I haven't
        asked him to.  Jzip uses ZIP's version 2.0 sources as a base.  
        Jzip changes ZIP in the following ways:

        on UNIX platforms:

        - Correct handling of the form in Infocom's Bureaucracy
        - new random function, called zip_random, that generates 
          numbers that are much more random.  The original random
          function still works best in DOS, and for now I assume
          on other platforms as well.  The new one is only compiled
          in on UNIX platforms.

        on all platforms:

        - The interpreter can now play Inform V8 games, as described
          by Graham Nelson in Inform 5.5 beta's documentation.  This
          feature has been tested and it works.  

        The real reason I started Jzip:
        I didn't like having a program named zip that conflicted with
        InfoZip's zip.  The rest just snowballed!
