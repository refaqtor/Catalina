************************** WHATS NEW IN THIS VERSION ***************************

Welcome to version 0.8

- The version number still bears a 0.x version because it is not fully checked
out for compliance with the ISO 7185 Pascal standard.

- This version had the "to do" list zeroed out, meaning that as far as I know,
it has all the requirements for ISO 7185 Pascal taken care of, and all 
outstanding bugs and issues addressed.

- P5 goes to the BSI tests next. Because the BSI tests are neither available,
nor distributable because of copyright restrictions, this means that everything
the BSI tests point out will need to also be addressed in the PAT and PRT tests
distributed with P5. This is an extensive process. Note that the PRT test does
not currently exist.

- It is intended that a document will be produced that outlines the changes that
were required to go from P4 to P5. The idea is that this document, along with
the "Pascal implementation: The P4 compiler" [Pemberton and daniels] will serve
as complete documentation for P5.

If you are trying out the P5 compiler, and encounter problems, I would 
appreciate feedback to:

samiam@moorecad.com

Your validated bugs will be incorporated into the todo.txt file.
