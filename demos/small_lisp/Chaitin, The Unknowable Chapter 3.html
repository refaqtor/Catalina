<h1>III. Gödel's Proof of his Incompleteness Theorem</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<i>
Discusses a LISP run exhibiting a fixed point, and a LISP run
which illustrates Gödel's proof of his incompleteness theorem.
</i>
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2>Fixed points, self-reference &amp; self-reproduction</h2>
Okay, let's put LISP to work!  First let me show you the trick at the
heart of Gödel's and Turing's proofs, the self-reference.
<p>
How can we enable a LISP expression to know itself?  Well, it's very
easy once you've seen the trick!  Consider the LISP function f(x) that
takes x into (('x)('x)).  In other words, f assumes that its argument
x is the lambda expression for a one-argument function, and it forms
the expression that applies x to x. It doesn't evaluate it, it just
creates it.  It doesn't actually apply x to x, it just creates the
expression that will do it.
</p><p>
You'll note that if we <b>were</b> to evaluate this expression
(('x)('x)), in it x is simultaneously program and data, active and
passive.
</p><p>
Okay, so let's pick a particular x, use f to make x into (('x)('x)),
and then run/evaluate the result!  And to which x shall we apply f?
Why, to f itself!
</p><p>
So f applied to f yields what?  It yields f applied to f, which is
what we started with!!  So f applied to f is a self-reproducing LISP
expression!
</p><p>
You can think of the first f, the one that's used as a function, as
the organism, and the second f, the one that's copied twice, that's the
genome. In other words, the first f is an organism, and the second 
f is its DNA! I think that that's the best way to remember this, by
thinking it's biology.  Just as in biology, where a organism cannot
copy itself directly but needs to contain a description of itself, the
self-reproducing function f cannot copy itself directly (because it
cannot read itself—and neither can <b>you</b>).  So f needs to be
given a (passive) copy of itself.  The biological metaphor is quite
accurate!
</p><p>
So in the next section I'll show you a LISP run where this actually
works.  There's just one complication, which is that what can
reproduce itself, in LISP just as in real life, depends on the
environment in which the organism finds itself.
</p><p>
(f f) works in an environment that has a definition for f, but that's
cheating!  What I want is a <b>stand-alone</b> LISP expression that
reproduces itself.  But f produces a stand-alone version of itself,
and <b>that</b> is the actual self-reproducing expression.  (f f) is like a
virus that works only in the right environment (namely in the cell
that it infects), because it's too simple to work on its own.
</p><p>
So, finally, here is the LISP run illustrating all this.  I hope you 
like it, and that it convinces you that it was worth the effort to learn
LISP!  After you understand this LISP run, I'll show you Gödel's proof.

<h2>A LISP Fixed Point</h2>
<pre>LISP Interpreter Run
 
[[[[[
 
 A LISP expression that evaluates to itself!
 
 Let f(x): x -&gt; (('x)('x))
 
 Then (('f)('f)) is a fixed point.
 
]]]]]
 
[Here is the fixed point done by hand:]
 
(
'lambda(x) cons cons "' cons x nil
           cons cons "' cons x nil
                nil
 
'lambda(x) cons cons "' cons x nil
           cons cons "' cons x nil
                nil
)
 
expression  ((' (lambda (x) (cons (cons ' (cons x nil)) (cons
            (cons ' (cons x nil)) nil)))) (' (lambda (x) (cons
             (cons ' (cons x nil)) (cons (cons ' (cons x nil))
             nil)))))
value       ((' (lambda (x) (cons (cons ' (cons x nil)) (cons
            (cons ' (cons x nil)) nil)))) (' (lambda (x) (cons
             (cons ' (cons x nil)) (cons (cons ' (cons x nil))
             nil)))))
 
 
[Now let's construct the fixed point.]
 
define (f x) let y [be] cons "' cons x nil  [ y is ('x)         ]
             [return] cons y cons y nil     [ return (('x)('x)) ]
 
define      f
value       (lambda (x) ((' (lambda (y) (cons y (cons y nil)))
            ) (cons ' (cons x nil))))
 
 
[Here we try f:]
 
(f x)
 
expression  (f x)
value       ((' x) (' x))
 
 
[Here we use f to calculate the fixed point:]
 
(f f)
 
expression  (f f)
value       ((' (lambda (x) ((' (lambda (y) (cons y (cons y ni
            l)))) (cons ' (cons x nil))))) (' (lambda (x) (('
            (lambda (y) (cons y (cons y nil)))) (cons ' (cons
            x nil))))))
 
 
[Here we find the value of the fixed point:]
 
eval (f f)
 
expression  (eval (f f))
value       ((' (lambda (x) ((' (lambda (y) (cons y (cons y ni
            l)))) (cons ' (cons x nil))))) (' (lambda (x) (('
            (lambda (y) (cons y (cons y nil)))) (cons ' (cons
            x nil))))))
 
 
[Here we check that it's a fixed point:]
 
= (f f) eval (f f)
 
expression  (= (f f) (eval (f f)))
value       true
 
 
[Just for emphasis:]
 
= (f f) eval eval eval eval eval eval (f f)
 
expression  (= (f f) (eval (eval (eval (eval (eval (eval (f f)
            )))))))
value       true

<h2>Metamathematics in LISP</h2>
Now on to Gödel's proof!
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110520024528/http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/unknowable/ch4.html">Turing's proof</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110520024528/http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/unknowable/ch5.html">mine</a> 
do not depend on the inner structure of the
formal axiomatic system being studied, but Gödel's proof does.
He needs to get his hands dirty, he needs to lift the hood of the car
and poke around in the engine!  In fact, what he needs to do is to
<b>confuse levels</b> and combine the theory and its metatheory.
That's how he can construct a statement in the theory that says that
it's unprovable.
</p><p>
In Gödel's original proof, he was working in Peano arithmetic,
which is just a formal axiomatic system for elementary number theory.
It's the theory for the natural numbers and plus, times, and equal.
So Gödel used Gödel numbering to <b>arithmetize
metamathematics</b>, to construct a numerical predicate Dem(p,t) that
is true iff p is the number of a proof and t is the number of the
theorem that p proves.
</p><p>
Gödel did it, but it was hard work, very hard work!  So instead,
I'm going to use LISP.  We'll need a way to express metamathematical
assertions using S-expressions.  We'll need to use S-expressions to
express proofs and theorems.  We need to construct a LISP function
(valid-proof? x) that returns the empty list nil if x is not a
valid proof, and that returns the S-expression for the theorem that
was demonstrated if x is a valid proof.  I won't actually
define/program out the LISP function valid-proof?.  I don't want
to get involved ``in the internal affairs'' of a particular formal
axiomatic system.  But you can see that it's not difficult.  Why not?
</p><p>
Well, that's because Gödel numbers are a difficult way to express
proofs, but S-expressions are a very natural way to do it.  An
S-expression is just a symbolic expression with explicit syntax, with
its structure completely indicated by the parentheses.  And it's easy
to write proof-checking algorithms using LISP functions.  LISP is a
natural language in which to express such algorithms.
</p><p>
So let's suppose that we have a definition for a LISP function
(valid-proof? x).  And let's assume that the formal axiomatic
system that we're studying is one in which you can talk about
S-expressions and the value of an S-expression.  Then how can we
construct a LISP expression that asserts that it's unprovable?
</p><p>
First of all, how can we state that an S-expression y is unprovable?
Well, it's just the statement that for all S-expressions x, it is not
the case that (valid-proof? x) is equal to y. So that's easy to
do.  So let's call the predicate that affirms this
is-unprovable.  Then what we need is this: a LISP expression of
the form (is-unprovable (value-of XXX)), and when you evaluate
the LISP expression XXX, it gives back this entire expression.
(value-of might more accurately be called lisp-value-of, just to make
the point that we are assuming that we can talk about LISP expressions
and their values in our formal axiomatic system.)
</p><p>
So we're almost there, because in order to do this we just need to use
the fixed-point trick from before in a slightly more complicated
manner.  Here's how:
