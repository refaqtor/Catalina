Catalina is an ANSI C compiler, with C libraries and utilities, for the Parallax Propeller family of microcontrollers. 

Catalina supports both internal and external memory models on both the Propeller 1 and 2, for program sizes up to 16Mb.

Catalina runs under Windows, Linux and its own self-hosted development enviroment (Catalyst).

Catalina supports command-line use (Windows, Linux and Catalyst) and an Integrated Development Environment (Windows and Linux).

Catalina supports the Lua scripting language, both stand-alone and embedded.

Catalina supports multi-threaded and multi-model programming. Catalina supports lightweight threads as well as Posix threads and Lua threads.

The main components of Catalina are:

-  catalina    : C compiler (Windows, Linux and Catalyst)
-  catalyst    : SD card program loader and self-hosted development environment
-  geany       : Integrated Development Environment (Windows and Linux)
-  payload     : Serial program loader (Windows and Linux)
-  comms       : VT100 terminal emulator (Windows only)
-  blackbox    : C source level debugger (Windows and Linux)
-  catapult    : Utility for building multi-model C programs (Windows and Linux)
-  parallelize : Utility for building parallel C programs (Windows and Linux)
-  spinnaker   : Propeller 1 Spin compiler and assembler (Windows and Linux)
-  p2asm       : Propeller 2 assembler (Windows, Linux and Catalyst)
