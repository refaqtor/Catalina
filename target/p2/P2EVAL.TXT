The P2_EVAL configuration file (P2EVAL.inc) is used when the Catalina 
symbol P2_EVAL is defined on the Catalina command-line (as -C P2_EVAL) or
included in the definition of CATALINA_DEFINE.

For example:

   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c -C P2_EVAL

or

   set CATALINA_DEFINE=P2_EVAL
   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c

The P2_EVAL configuration file supports all revisions of the Propeller 2 
Evaluation Board (64000).

The P2_EVAL configuration file includes XMM RAM definitions to suit the 
Parallax Hyper RAM add-on board. This used as additional RAM storage by 
linking with the hyper library (i.e. adding -lhyper to the Catalina command 
line). It can be used as XMM RAM simply by specifying -C LARGE or -C SMALL
on the command line (-C HYPER can be added but is the default for this
platform, so this is not usually required)
