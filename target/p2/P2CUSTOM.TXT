The P2_CUSTOM configuration file (P2CUSTOM.inc) is used when the Catalina 
symbol P2_CUSTOM is defined on the Catalina command-line (as -C P2_CUSTOM) or
included in the definition of CATALINA_DEFINE.

For example:

   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c -C P2_CUSTOM

or

   set CATALINA_DEFINE=P2_CUSTOM
   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c

The P2_CUSTOM configuration file is intended to be modified to suit any
platform not otherwise supported by Catalina. It is also the default
configuration file used if no other file is specified by defining an
appropriate Catalina symbol. By default, P2_CUSTOM is configured the same
as the P2_EDGE, but since it is intended to be modified, this should not
be relied upon, and a specific board should always be specifiesd. 

The P2_CUSTOM configuration file includes XMM RAM definitions to suit the 
P2_EDGE board, but also include the following lines, which generate an error
message if an XMM program is compiled. The lines can be removed if desired:

   #error P2_CUSTOM DOES NOT SUPPORT XMM LARGE MODE

   #error P2_CUSTOM DOES NOT SUPPORT XMM SMALL MODE
