The P2D2 configuration file (P2D2.inc) is used when the Catalina symbol P2D2
is defined on the Catalina command-line (as -C P2D2) or included in the 
definition of CATALINA_DEFINE.

For example:

   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c -C P2D2

or

   set CATALINA_DEFINE=P2D2
   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c

The P2D2 was never released, so the configuration files for it have never been
tested and cannot be supported. However, since some people received prototype 
boards, the preliminary support files created for it have been left in place. 

The file P2D2.inc contains the following line, which generates an error 
message if the files are used. This line can be removed if desired:

   #error P2D2 NOT SUPPORTED YET
