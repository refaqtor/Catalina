This program implements a memory test for the XMM RAM.

To compile it, use the command "build_ram_test", specifying the platform - e.g:

   build_ram_test HYDRA

or

   build_ram_test C3 CACHED_1K FLASH


This builds three versions of the program:

   RAM_Test_PC
   RAM_Test_TV
   RAM_Test_VGA

The only difference is that one uses a PC terminal emulator for its output, 
one uses a local TV display, and one uses a local VGA display. 

The PC option is generally the most useful, as results may scroll off the local 
display too quickly to read - but on the HYDRA and the HYBRID, the serial I/O 
port cannot be used at the same time as the XMM RAM, so the TV version MUST
be used on those platforms. The VGA version can be used on the DRACBLADE or 
the DEMO board. On the TRIBLADEPROP, use the PC version.
