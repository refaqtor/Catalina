# To build lcc under linux, set the environment variable LCCDIR to the
# deirectory where you unpacked the Catalina source, and then use the 
# script file "build_all"
#
# Note: 
#  The file etc/catalina_linux.c assumes that the linux directory that
#  contains the 'mv' command is in /bin - if it is not, edit the file.
