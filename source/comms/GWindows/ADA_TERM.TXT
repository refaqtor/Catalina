The version of GWindows used with this version of the Ada Terminal Emulator
was GWindows release, 13-Nov-2022 [revision 459]. You must obtain that
specific release from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnavi/files

Rather than distributng the whole of GWindows, this folder contains only
those files that need to be modified to use that release. Install that
release of GWindows and then copy these files over the corresponding
gwindows\framework files.
