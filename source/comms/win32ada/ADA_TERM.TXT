The current release of win32ada is missing some baud rates needed by the Ada
Terminal Emulator Comms programs, and the build file assumes that the 'which'
utility has been installed, but this is not installed by GNAT Studio. Also,
it seems to incorrectly detect Win64, so the project file has to be manually
amended for that, and also to specify the build and library types.

After installing win32ada, but before building it, copy these files over the 
corresponding win32ada files. If you have already built win32da then you will
to rebuild it.
