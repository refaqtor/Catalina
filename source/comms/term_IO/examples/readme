This directory contains a copy of the Gnat Examples Directory, modified to use
the Terminal Emulator package Term_IO in place of Text_IO. 

See the Ada Terminal Emulator Reference Guide for more details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the Gnat Examples Directory. Our goal is to provide the gnat user some
pieces of code that are easy to understand, easy to modify and to play with,
and which demonstrate either :
    - some classic Ada features
    - some new Ada 95 features
    - some good pedagogical programming exercises
If you are insterested in sharing your own programs with the Gnat community,
please tune them with the latest Gnat version and send it with appropriate
documentation (and bug reports) to report@gnat.com.

On unix systems -- a simple "make" should build and execute theses programs.

1- simple_io

  provides (extremely) basic Input-Output facilities with a text_io-like
  syntax. A "Hello World" program is used as main unit.

  Note: this uses the s-io.ads/adb package and the file a-cio.c which has
  already been compiled as part of the GNAT Run Time Library therefore that
  do not need to be compiled again or mentioned on the gnatbl command. To
  examine these sources look in the RTL source directory (see gnat-intro
  for details).

2- text_io_example
  trivial demonstration of a use of text_io.

3- use_of_import
  trivial example of calling a C function from an Ada program.

4- tgef - a simple test of the GEF (Generic Elementary Functions) package
   of the Ada Numerics annex. The example produces a classical Sin wave.

5- tef - similar to tgef except here we use the Elementary_Functions package
   which is not generic and therefore requires no instantiation. It is defined
   for type Float.  The example produces three overlayed graphs of Sin, Cos and
   Arctan.

6- instruments

  A very simple simulation of car dashboard instruments. Demonstrates
  simple type extension, dispatching and child unit. 2 main programs are
  provided, demo1 and demo2.
