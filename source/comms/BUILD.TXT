1. Install GNAT. Get it from https://www.adacore.com/download
   I used GNAT Community 2021 edition (the file name for this is 
   gnat-2021-20210519-x86_64-windows64-bin.exe). You need to install at least
   the GNAT compiler toolchain and the GNAT Studio IDE. 

   I installed it to C:\GNAT\2021. If you install it elsewhere you will need
   to modify some of the commands given below accordingly.

2. Install GWindows Get it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnavi/files/
   I used GWindows 13-Nov-2022.exe. 

   I installed it to C:\GNAT\GWindows. If you install it elsewhere you will 
   need to modify some of the commands given below accordingly.

   NOTE: You must select ANSI during the installation process. 

3. Install win32ada. Get it from https://github.com/AdaCore/win32ada 
   I used win32ada-23.0.0.zip. 

   I installed it to C:\GNAT\win32ada. If you install it elsewhere you will 
   need to modify some of the commands given below accordingly.

4. Install The Ada Terminal Emulator. 

   I installed it to C:\GNAT\Terminal. If you install it elsewhere you will 
   need to modify some of the commands given below accordingly.

5. Open a command window. Copy the win32ada modifications from the Terminal 
   Emulator to win32ada:

   cd c:\GNAT\Terminal\
   xcopy /S /Y win32ada ..\win32ada

   NOTE: If you installed GNAT Studio to somewhere other than C:\GNAT\2021
         then you will need to edit the win32ada\Makefile

6. Open a command window. Ensure the GNAT toolchain is in your path, go to 
   where you installed win32ada and build and install it. For example:

   cd c:\GNAT\win32ada
   set PATH=C:\GNAT\2021\bin;%PATH%
   make build
   make install

7. Copy the GWindows modifications from the Terminal Emulator to GWindows:

   cd c:\GNAT\Terminal\
   xcopy /S /Y GWindows ..\GWindows

   NOTE: You do not need to rebuild GWindows.

8. Make sure the GNAT toolchain is in your path, and build each of the
   Terminal components:

   cd c:\GNAT\Terminal\
   set PATH=C:\GNAT\2021\bin;%PATH%
   gnatmake -P emulator\emulator
   gnatmake -P redirect\redirect
   gnatmake -P telnet\telnet
   gnatmake -P demos\demos
   gnatmake -P comms\comms
   gnatmake -P term_IO\term_IO

9. To clean the folers, use the following commands (note that
   this will also delete the binaries from the bin directory!):

   gnatclean -P emulator\emulator
   gnatclean -P redirect\redirect
   gnatclean -P telnet\telnet
   gnatclean -P demos\demos
   gnatclean -P comms\comms
   gnatclean -P term_IO\term_IO
