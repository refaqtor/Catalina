The file CatalinaDebugFileGenerator.zip contains the source code for the 
C# version of the Catalina component which generates a combined .dbg file from
the multiple .debug files generated by Catalina. It is invoked automatically by
Catalina when the -g or -g3 command line options are used.

This component was developed by Bob Anderson to support the BlackCat debugger.
It is also used by the BlackBox debugger. It was translated to C++ by Ross Higson,
so this version is no longer required - see the C++ version in the directory
catalina\source.

The zip file contains a Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 project with all source 
code, and you will need that product installed to compile it. However, note
that it not necessary to recompile this component even if Catalina itself is 
recompiled.
