1. Added '-a' command line option to specify that alternate "homespun"-like 
   preprocessor behavior be used:

   - Encountering a #error statement terminates the compilation.
   - Files included with #include will be found if they exist anywhere 
     in the include directories specified on the command line.
   - Symbols defined with no value (or on the command line) will not be
     used for macro substitution - they can only be used in #ifdef and 
     #ifndef statements. For example:

     #define FOO
     #ifndef FOO
     #error FOO is not defined!  <-- FOO is defined under either set of rules
     #endif
     PUB START | FOO,BAR         <-- generates an error if -h is not used


2. Added '-M' to specify memory size. The default is 32768, but any size
   up to 16777216 can be specified. This is commonly used to specify an
   EEPROM size. DAT, binary and eeprom files can be generated of any size 
   up to the specified memory size, but if memory sizes larger than 32768 
   are generated then some programs may be able to use the resulting dat 
   files, but only Catalina will be able to use the binary and eeprom 
   files, since it does not depend on the internal file offsets which are 
   limited in these file formats to 16 bits.
 
3. Added -b and -e to specify whether a binary or eeprom format output file
   should be created. The default is binary. The size of the output file 
   when -e is specified (or the maximum size when -b is specified) defaults 
   to 32k, but this can be overriden by using the '-M' command line switch.

4. Fixed a bug where the preprocessor would lose track of the state of
   complex #if[n]def statements (e.g. if they contain #include statements).

5. Fixed a bug where the name of the file containing the start of a 
   #if[n]def statement was incorrectly reported if the statement was not
   terminated correctly.

6. Fixed a bug that resulted in some source lines being incorrectly detected
   as comment lines.

7. Fixed a bug that resulted in macro substitution within string constants.

8. Added a listing capability, enabled by specifying '-l'. The listing only
   contains DAT sections at present - it may be expanded later to include
   other sections.
