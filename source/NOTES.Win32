# To build Catalina under Windows, set the environment variable LCCDIR to the
# directory where you unpacked the Catalina source, and then use the 
# batch file "build_all.bat"
#
# Note that it is important that the mingw version of make appears in your PATH
# variable before the version installed with Catalina. Otherwise you will get 
# errors when building Lua, which also relies on other mingw utilities.
